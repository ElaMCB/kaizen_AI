            <p class="intro-text">
                Each detail matters. Each imperfection is a teacher. Each day is an opportunity to refine. 
                This is how we build—with exquisite attention, translated for our time.

                    <h3>Shokunin (職人)</h3>
                    <p>The craftsman's spirit. Not perfection, but the relentless pursuit of mastery. In AI, this means every test case, every validation, every metric is crafted with intention. Quality is not a feature—it is the foundation.</p>

                    <h3>Monozukuri (ものづくり)</h3>
                    <p>The art of making things. Not just building, but understanding the essence of what you create. In our work, this means seeing beyond the algorithm to the system, beyond the code to the experience, beyond the model to the trust it must earn.</p>

                <div class="philosophy-card">
                    <h3>The Principle</h3>
                    <p>Quality is invisible when done well. It reveals itself not in grand gestures, but in the absence of failures, in the confidence of deployment, in the trust of those who depend on your work.</p>

                <p><strong>Kaizen in AI</strong> means treating every model, pipeline, and deployment as a living process that gets better over time. Instead of one-off builds, we emphasize:</p>
                <ul class="principles-list">
                    <li><strong>Small, daily improvements</strong> in code quality and test coverage</li>

                    <li><strong>Long-term metrics tracking</strong> for sustained performance</li>

            <div class="vision-content">
                <p class="vision-question">
                    What if every AI system we build today is still running flawlessly in 2030? 
                    What if the tests we write today catch bugs that don't exist yet? 
                    What if the quality practices we establish become the foundation others build upon?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is not about perfection. This is about <strong>building for the future</strong>—creating systems that age gracefully, 
                    that others can trust, that become better over time rather than worse.
                </p>
                <p class="commitment">
                    <strong>The commitment:</strong> Every line of code, every test, every validation is a message to the future. 
                    It says: <em>"I cared enough to do this right. You can build on this. You can trust this."</em>
                </p>
                <p class="fun-part">
                    <strong>The fun part:</strong> In 10 years, when someone opens this codebase, they won't find technical debt and shortcuts. 
                    They'll find a system that still works, tests that still pass, and quality that has only improved. 
                    They'll think: <em>"Whoever built this really understood quality."</em>
